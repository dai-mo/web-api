NPM Support
===========

NPM support currently exists only for install typings.

 * Add the dt reference for the relevant project in the typings.json file
 * run 'npm install'
 * run 'npm run typings install'
 * delete the node_modules directory

The step of deleting the node_modules directory is very important because,
 * By default, the sbt play plugins will copy over the libs in the node_modules directory at the root of the project (if it exists)
 * Currently, there does not seem to be a mechanism in sbt to ignore the node_modules dir or to configure the node_modules
   dir when executing 'npm install' (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2734)
